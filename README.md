## 🧠 How to Play

1. Everyone reads a secret word — except **one player**: the **impostor**.
2. Two rounds of questions follow. Each player answers in turn.
   - The goal: Prove you know the word.
   - But be careful — give too much detail, and the impostor might guess it!
3. After both rounds, everyone votes on who they think the impostor is.
4. The impostor then tries to guess the word to win!

Simple to learn, tricky to master. Perfect for game nights, parties, and social gatherings.
