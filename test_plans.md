## ðŸ“‹ Test Strategy

### Testing Approach

- **Manual Testing**: Primary method for UI/UX and gameplay flow
- **Automated Testing**: Unit tests for business logic and state management
- **Regression Testing**: CI/CD integration with the set of tests

## ðŸ§ª Test Plans

## Test Plan 1: Player Management Testing

| Test Case | Steps                               | Expected Result                         | Priority |
| --------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------- |
| TC-001.1  | Add valid player name               | Name added to player list               | High     |
| TC-001.2  | Add Player Name at Character Limits           | 1 character and 15 character names accepted and added to list  | High     |
| TC-001.3  | Add duplicate Player Names    | Name accepted or appropriate validation | Medium   |
| TC-001.4  | Remove Player from list | Selected Player successfully deleted from the list     | High     |
| TC-001.5  | Try to add 11th player              | Disabled add functionality, player limit enforced    | High     |

## Test Plan 2: Game Setup Testing

| Test Case | Steps                             | Expected Result                    | Priority |
| --------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------- |
| TC-002.1  | Start Game with Minimum Players (3)         | One impostor assigned randomly, all 3 players are included in the game     | High |
| TC-002.2  | Start Game with Maximum Players (10)      |   One impostor assigned randomly, all 3 players are included in the game     | High |
| TC-002.3  | Attempt Start Game with Insufficient Players           | system prevents game start with less than minimum required players        | High |

## Test Plan 3: Game Flow

| Test Case | Steps                 | Expected Result                      | Priority |
| --------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------- |
| TC-003.1  | Complete Full Game Round - Basic Flow     | Complete game flow from start to finish with minimal players   | Critical     |
| TC-003.2  | Impostor Assignment Randomization   | Impostor is randomly assigned and changes between games              | Medium     |
